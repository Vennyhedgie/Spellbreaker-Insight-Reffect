# Spellbreaker-Insight-Reffect
A more visible UI element for Warrior's Spellbreaker Elite Specialization

Tracks stacks of Attacker's Insight (up to 5) which is obtained on disable or boonstrip, granting 50 Power, Precision and Ferocity per stack. 
This mechanic is quite crucial to maximizing Spellbreaker damage and felt like it was a part of its core design.

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

# Notes

This effect is made with Normal interface size. If you use a different one, you can resize all the elements at once by right-clicking on the pack and selecting resize. Alternatively, you can move the pack's position on screen if needed, though it should be aligned by default.
