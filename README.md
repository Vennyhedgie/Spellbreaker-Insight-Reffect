# Spellbreaker-Insight-Reffect
A more visible UI element for Warrior's Spellbreaker Elite Specialization

Tracks stacks of Attacker's Insight (up to 5) which is obtained on disable or boonstrip, granting 50 Power, Precision and Ferocity per stack. 
This mechanic is quite crucial to maximizing Spellbreaker damage and felt like it was a part of its core design.
